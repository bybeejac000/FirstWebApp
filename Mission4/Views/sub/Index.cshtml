        <h2>Tips for New Runners</h2>
        <p>If you're just getting started with running, my biggest advice is to take it one step at a time—literally! Start with short, manageable distances and gradually build your endurance. Make sure to invest in a good pair of running shoes to prevent injuries and listen to your body as you increase your mileage. Most importantly, find joy in the process! Running isn’t just about speed or distance; it’s about discovering what your body is capable of and enjoying the journey along the way.</p>
